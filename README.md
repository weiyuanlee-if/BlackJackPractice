# BlackJackPractice
Practice project from Scrimba's Learn Javascript for Free. I watched the course and followed along in the site's editor. I then made my own version with minimal CSS. This project would help me build skills for my future interactive fiction game in Phaser 3, I Will Bury You, which is a game involving cards and dice but instead it's more like a TTRPG rather than Black Jack. I also added in a few features that were not done in the tutorial such as a: dice, spending game money/chips and reset without refreshing the browser.

What this project helped me level up in:

- Build JS fundamentals
- Build DOM fundamentals
- Basic Game logic
