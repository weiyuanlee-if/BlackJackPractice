# BlackJackPractice
Practice project inspired by Scrimba's Learn Javascript for Free that's remade into a game closer resembling BlackJack. I watched the course and followed along in the site's editor. I then made my own version with minimal CSS and expanded code and rules. The course only had a player with random cards and no chips. I added in a few features that were not done in the tutorial such as: Dealer AI, betting chips, reset, and responsiveness. This project would help me build skills for my future interactive fiction game in Phaser 3, I Will Bury You. 

What this project helped me level up in:

- Build JS fundamentals
- Build DOM fundamentals
- Basic Game logic
