# BlackJackPractice
Practice project from Scrimba's Learn Javascript for Free. I watched the course and followed along in the site's editor. Then made my own with minimal CSS, a bit of dialogue, and the actual rules of BlackJack. This project would help me build skills for my future interactive fiction game in Phaser, I Will Bury You. 

What this project has done for me
- Build JS fundamentals
- Build DOM fundamentals
- Basic Game logic
- Local Storage
